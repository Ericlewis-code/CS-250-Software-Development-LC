How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  
  User stories are a useful tool for understanding user needs and incorporating them into programs. A user story 
is a short, one or to sentence description of a user's need that includes a user persona, a goal, and a benefit.
These accounts give a clear understanding of the needs and expectations of the user and aid in defining the project's scope. 
Agile development methodologies like Scrum or Kanban, which involve working in brief sprints and iterating based on feedback from 
the users, can be used to incorporate the user stories into a program. You can develop software that satisfies the needs and expectations 
of the user by comprehending their viewpoint and decomposing the user's requirements into doable tasks.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My preferred method for creating programs is to first create a UML diagram or pseudocode to lay out all of the information 
required for the application. ensuring that I am aware of what each class and subclass will perform and how they will 
collaborate to create a useful program. The backlogs, standup meetings, and user stories are the agile methods that I 
believe will be most helpful to me in my future development.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Technical proficiency, effective communication, and teamwork abilities are necessary for productive teamwork in software development. 
It necessitates being able to work effectively with people, being proactive and taking initiative, and, being eager to learn and share 
knowledge. An effective team member is dedicated to the project's and the teams overall success
